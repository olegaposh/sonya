          I am a poet, educator, yogi and soul coach residing in the Los Angeles area. I aim to spread love, light and peace through her contemplative words and uplifting messages. I intend for my poetic meditations to be the catalysts for people of all backgrounds to see past the illusory veil of separateness that divides us and to begin to see with a new perspective of unity, limitless possibility and balance. In a world filled with distractions, where everything is constantly moving at lightning speed, my message is one that draws from various spiritual traditions and focuses on spreading the ancient wisdom that is at the root of all of the world’s faiths.  It is my intention to uplift, transform and guide those who seek to connect with the divine and eternal source of all. I do this through my poetic meditations, inspiring yoga classes, healing women’s circles and retreats and one on one coaching sessions.  It is my sincere wish to be of service and to help make this world a better place.  If my message speaks to you, please reach out and connect!
